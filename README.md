# Wound Segmentation and Detection using U-Net

## Overview
This project implements an end-to-end deep learning pipeline for **automatic wound segmentation** from medical images using a **U-Net architecture**.  
The goal is to accurately identify and segment wound regions at the pixel level to support medical image analysis and decision-making.

The project covers the complete workflow:
- Image and mask preprocessing
- U-Net model design
- Model training
- Inference on unseen test images
- Visual and quantitative evaluation

## Problem Statement
Manual wound segmentation is time-consuming, subjective, and prone to inter-observer variability.  
This project aims to automate wound segmentation using deep learning, enabling consistent and accurate wound boundary detection from images.



## Ethical Considerations
Due to medical data privacy and ethical constraints:
- Raw images and segmentation masks are **not included**
- The repository focuses on the **pipeline and methodology**

Paths in the notebook are placeholders and should be updated by users with their own datasets.
